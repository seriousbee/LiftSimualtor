 * COMP201P Lift Simulator Coursework.

 * 
 * Tests whether a person blocks when pushing 'callFloor'
 * until the lift reaches that floor and opens its door
 * (assuming the lift is going in the correct direction).
 *
 * This does NOT check whether the lift controller correctly
 * indicates whether doors should open (i.e. Test 1) since we
 * are unit testing orthogonal functionality (the correct
 * blocking/release of people threads).
