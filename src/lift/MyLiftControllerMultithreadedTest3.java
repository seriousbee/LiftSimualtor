/**
 * COMP201P Lift Simulator Coursework.
 * Framework for Unit Testing MyLiftController class.
 * 
 * This tests whether the lift controller correctly informs the lift
 * whether to open its doors (or not) at particular levels when the
 * 'selectFloor' method is called.
 *
 * Again it just tries to test this single 'unit' of functionality while
 * not reporting other problems (tested within Test1 & Test2).
 *
 * However it tries to do this within the context of a complete person lifecycle
 * in case there are dependencies within the lift controller.
 * (So it is possible this test may fail since Test2 fails because the people
 * threads may remain blocked in 'pushUp/DownButton' when they should have continued.)
