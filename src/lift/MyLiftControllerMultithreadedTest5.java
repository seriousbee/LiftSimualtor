/**
 * COMP201P Lift Simulator Coursework.
 * Framework for Unit Testing MyLiftController class.
 * 
 * This attempts to test that the 'lift thread' DOES NOT return
 * until all threads entering and exiting the lift at a particular
 * floor have entered or exited ... thereupon it can close the doors.
 *
 * There is a possibility that this test will fail occasionally
 * since threads will be switched just outside the monitor
 * region before registering they have left ... hence this
 * test should be run multiple times to see percentage of
 * failures (this failure of the test should be uncommon).
