/**
 * COMP201P Lift Simulator Coursework.
 * Framework for Unit Testing MyLiftController class.
 * 
 * This tests whether the person correctly exits the lift
 * after it has opened its doors on the correct floor.
 *
 * Again it just tries to test this 'unit' of functionality while not
 * reporting other problems (tested within Test1 / Test2 / Test3 / Test4).
 *
 * However it tries to do this in context of a complete person lifecycle in
 * case there are dependencies within the lift controller.
 * (So this test may fail since Test2 fails because the people threads
 *  may remain blocked in 'pushUp/DownButton' when they should have continued.)
